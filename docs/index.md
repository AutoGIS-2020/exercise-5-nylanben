## My maps

This is my static map. It shows the distances to nearest bus stops from 250m x 250m grid square centroids in Helsinki region. Link to the original HSL data used in both of the maps: (https://hri.fi/data/en_GB/dataset/hsl-n-joukkoliikenteen-pysakit)

My interactive map shows the locations of tram stops that are in use in Helsinki. On the other layer there is a heatmap to show better the uneven distribution of the stops.
